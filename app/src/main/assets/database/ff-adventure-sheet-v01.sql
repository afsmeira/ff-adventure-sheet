-- We want the DB to start pre-populated, and that must be done through an asset file.
-- That asset file is generate by running these SQL statements in sqlite:
--      `sqlite3 ff-adventure-sheet-v01.db < ff-adventure-sheet-v01.sql`
-- Alongside this, Room uses the Entity classes and Daos to generate a schema file. The schema file
-- also has SQL statements, and could create the DB tables (and thus we wouldn't need to do it
-- here), and indexes, but the current SQL runs before that and we can't run just INSERT statements
-- because there are no tables yet.
-- The problem is that we must keep the DDL of this file in sync with the Entity classes and daos.
-- **However**, we are letting Room create tables that are not necessary upfront and indexes on
-- foreign keys.
-- TODO Investigate initializing the DB through code
